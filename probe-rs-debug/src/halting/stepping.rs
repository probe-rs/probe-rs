/// Currently we have support for 'instruction' level stepping, as well
/// as 'step-over' 'step-into', and 'step-out' at 'statement' level.
/// Note: Because of the way the DWARF debug information is currently generated by the Rust compiler,
/// (no explicity 'basic_block' information is generated), the the 'step over' functionality
/// at 'statement' level will be rare, and most often, we will have to fall back to

    /// - This implementation builds on the [SourceLocation] implementation, with additional heurstics
    ///   available based on the halted target's stackframe information, to determine suitable target locations
    ///   for stepping.
    /// - If a hardware breakpoint is available, we will set it at the desired location, run to it, and release it.
    /// - If no hardware breakpoints are available, we will do repeated instruction steps until we reach the desired location.
    /// ### Usage Note:
    /// - Currently, no special provision is made for the effect of interrupts that get triggered
    ///   during stepping. The user must ensure that interrupts are disabled during stepping, or
    ///   accept that stepping may be diverted by the interrupt processing on the core.

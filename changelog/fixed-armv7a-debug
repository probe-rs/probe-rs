Bug fixes for ARMv7A debug:
- Only read MVFR0 when CP10/11 are enabled
- Consider UND_L an abort alongside data/prefetch aborts
- Disable ITR before sending RRQ as required by the architecture
- Use reset vector catch for reset-halt instead of requesting halt then
  resetting
- Warn if core isn't halted after reset-halt

///
/// **JTAG-DP:** The Read Buffer is architecturally defined to provide a DP read operation that does not have any side effects. This definition allows a debugger to insert a DP read of RDBUFF at the end of a sequence of operations, to return the final AP Read Result and ACK values.
///
/// *SW-DP:** On an SW-DP, the Read Buffer presents data that was captured during the previous AP read, enabling repeatedly returning the value without generating a new AP access.
///
/// **Note**
///
/// After reading the DP Read Buffer, its contents are no longer valid. The result of a second read of the DP Read Buffer is UNKNOWN.
///
/// If you require the value from an AP register read, that read must be followed by one of:
/// - A second AP register access, with the appropriate AP selected as the current AP.
/// - A read of the DP Read Buffer.
///
/// The second access to either the AP or the DP stalls until the result of the original AP read is available.

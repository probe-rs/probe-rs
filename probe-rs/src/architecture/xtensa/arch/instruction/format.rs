//! Instruction formats implemented as functions.
//!
//! Instruction formats are common bytecode formats used to simplify instruction implementation.
//! They are implemented with an opcode and a set of more-or-less standardised slots where
//! instructions may define their operands.
//!
//! For more information, see the Xtensa ISA documentation.

/// The concept of an instruction block is based on
/// [Rust's MIR basic block definition](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/appendix/background.html#cfg)
/// The concept is also a close match for how the DAP specification defines the a `statement`
/// [SteppingGranularity](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/specification#Types_SteppingGranularity)
/// In the context of the `probe-rs` debugger, an instruction block is a contiguous series of instructions
/// which belong to a single [`Sequence`].
/// The key difference between instructions in a block, and those in a [`gimli::LineSequence`], is that we can rely
/// on the 'next' instruction in the block to be the 'next' instruction the processor will execute (barring any interrupts).
/// ### Implementation discussion:
/// Indentifying the boundaries of each [`Block`] is the key to identifying valid halt locations, and is the primary
/// purpose of the [`Block`] struct. Current versions of Rust (up to rustc 1.76.0) does not populate the
/// `DW_LNS_basic_block` attribute of the line program rows in the DWARF debug information. The implication of this is that
/// we need to infer the boundaries of each block withing the sequence of instructions, from other blocks, as well as
/// from the prologue and epilogue markers. The approach taken is as follows:
/// - To facilitate 'stepping', we also need to identify how blocks transition from one to the next,
///   and unlike inside a sequence, these are typically not sequential addresses. The `stepped_from` and `steps_to`
///   fields are used to identify the addresses of the instructions that are the left and right edges of the block.
///   The DWARF line program rows do not have enough information to identify branching instructions, and so we
///   cannot rely on the sequence of instructions in a line program sequence to identify the block boundaries.
///   To avoid having to interpret the Assembly instructions for every architecture, we use some basic heuristics
///   to identify block boundaries. Some of these can be inferred from the DWARF debug information, while others
///   can only be assessed using information about the stackframes in an unwinding context.
/// - The DWARF based heuristics used to identify block boundaries are as follows:
///   - The first block is the prologue block, and is identified by the `DW_LNS_set_prologue_end` attribute on the first
///   - first insruction after the prologue.
///   - The `DW_NLS_epilogue_begin` instructions are always in their own block, and linked with preceding blocks
///     based on available line and column information.
///   - The first block after the prologue, steps directly from the prologue block.
///   - Inlined code (functions or macros) always precede the instruction that called them. They have their
///     own blocks, and the last one is linked to the instruction that called them.
///   - If a function/sequence has multiple ranges, then the instructions in those ranges are assumed to be
///     divergent in some way, and are therefore in separate blocks.
///   - The remaining instructions are grouped into blocks containing the contiguous instructions belonging to the same
///     source file line.
